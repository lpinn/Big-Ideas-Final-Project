Looking at the fire data, it would seem that Mount Oliver Borough and Regend Square were tied with the least amount of fires, at six incidents each. However, this alone does not indicate that these are the best neighborhoods, unless one is really into fire safety. As a metric, I would say that a singular fire is worth about the same as a tree, except it deducts the value (the logic being that the less fires the better). This means that though Mount Oliver Borough and Regend Square had the least fires, if they don't have many trees or parks they still would not be able to compete for the position of "best neighborhood"
