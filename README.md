Abstract:   

Pittsburgh has many neighborhoods, all differentiated by a multitude of characteristics such as crime rate, number of schools, and housing quality. Finding the best neighborhood requires analyzation of multiple factors to reach an unbiased and correct conclusion. This project analyzed three particular factors: trees, playgrounds, and fires to find the best environmental neighborhood which is also safe. A point system was implemented where each tree was given 0.1 point, each playground was given 2 points, and each fire deducted 0.05 points. Squirrel Hill South was determined to be the best neighborhood using this criteria.
