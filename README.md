Abstract:   

We are trying to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by analyzing three datasets found on the WPRDC. To decide which three datasets we wanted to analyze, we looked for complete, rich in information, and extensive datasets. We also wanted to look at the environmental aspect of the city and looked at the following three datasets:

Trees -  https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees/resource/1515a93c-73e3-4425-9b35-1cd11b2196da
Playgrounds - https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playgrounds/resource/47350364-44a8-4d15-b6e0-5f79ddff9367
Fires -  https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh/resource/8d76ac6b-5ae8-4428-82a4-043130d17b02

We created a point system as well. For one tree, we assign 0.1 points. For one playground, we assign 2 points. For oen fire, we deduct -0.05 points. 

We came to the conclusion that Squirrel Hill South was the best neighborhood. There are other factors that may have affected this conclusion. For example, not all trees may not have been counted because only one organization counted it. Also, Squirrel Hill South (SHS) has Schenley Park so that might be the reason why SHS won. 

Winner: Squirrel Hill South
